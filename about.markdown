Hi, my name is Vlado Cingel and I'm a Rails expert from Croatia.

In 2005 while trying to find best way to organize my PHP apps I found Ruby and Rails and never looked back. There is no version and functionallity of Rails that I haven't worked with and still enjoy it like the first day.

If you would like to contact me, please check the links in the footer :)
